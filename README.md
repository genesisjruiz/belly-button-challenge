# Module 14: Interactive Visualizations
In this module's Challenge, I created an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes found in human navels. Using JavaScript, D3.js, and Plotly.js, I built the dashboard to fetch data from a JSON file and used it to construct a bar chart, bubble chart and a metadata panel.
